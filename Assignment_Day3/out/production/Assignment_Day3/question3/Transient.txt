****************  Transient Key Word  ****************

- transient is a Modifier Application Only for Variables.
- At the Time of Serialization if we don't want to Save the Value of a Particular Variable to Meet Security Constraints then we should go for transient Key Word.
- At the Time of Serialization JVM Ignores Original Value of transient Variables and Save Default Value to the File
- Hence transient Means Not to Serialize.



****************  static vs transient  ****************

- Static Variables are not part of Object State and Hence they won't Participate in Serialization.
- Due to this Declaring a Static Variable as transient there is No Use of impact.



****************  final vs transient  ****************

- final Variables will be participated in Serialization Directly by their Values.
- Due to this declaring a final Variable as transient there is No Use or impact.
